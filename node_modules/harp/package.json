Harp comes with a built-in web-server that automatically \npre-processes [jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), \n[stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), [less](http://lesscss.org/), and [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/). Zero \nconfiguration is required.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Features](#features)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Quick Start](#quickstart)\n- [The Rules (how it works)](#rules)\n  - [Rule 1 - Convention over configuration](#rules-1)\n  - [Rule 2 - Public directory is public](#rules-2)\n  - [Rule 3 - Ignore those which start with underscore](#rules-3)\n  - [Rule 4 - Dead simple asset pipeline](#rules-4)\n  - [Rule 5 - Flexible metadata](#rules-5)\n- [Docs](#docs)\n  - [CLI Usage](#cli-usage)\n  - [Lib Usage](#lib-usage)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [License](#license)\n\n<a name=\"features\"/>\n### Features\n  - **zero configuration** - just start building your app.\n  - **asset pipeline** - built-in asset pipeline for seamlessly serving of [jade](http://jade-lang.com/), [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/), [less](http://lesscss.org/), and [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) files.\n  - **layouts and partials** - the beloved layout/partial templating paradigm you know and love.\n  - **global variables** - specify global variables to be available in all your templates.\n  - **selected state** - a `current` object is available in all your templates for determining the current page.\n  - **traverse filesystem** - iterate over your filesystem to easily generate things like an html5 cache manifest file.\n  - **asset ordering** - easy to list the order your assets are referenced.\n  - **server** - harp ships with a built-in server (with LRU caching in production mode).\n\nMaintained by [@sintaxi](http://twitter.com/sintaxi). Made for the [@HarpPlatform](http://twitter.com/HarpPlatform).\n\n<a name=\"installation\"/>\n### Installation\n\n    npm install -g harp\n\n<a name=\"quickstart\"/>\n### Quick Start\n\nCreating a new harp application is a breeze...\n\n    harp init myproj; cd myproj\n    harp server\n  \nYour Harp application is now running at http://localhost:9966\n    \n<a name=\"rules\"/>\n## The Rules\n\nRather than offering a complex feature set, harp has simple rules on how it works. Harp is a katana, not a swiss army knife. By understanding the rules, one will know how to effectively use harp.\n\n<a name=\"rules-1\"/>\n### 1) Convention over Configuration.\n\nHarp will function with as little as a `public/index.html` file and doesn't require any configuration to get going. To add more routes just add more files. All harp's features are based off conventions that you will discover by learning the rest of these rules. Harp is about offering a sane development framework which follows established best practices. Harp is not designed to be everything to everyone, but what it does, it does perfectly.\n\n**Design Rationale:** By using convention over configuration, harp is easier to learn, which makes you more productive. \n\n**Anatomy of a typical harp application:**\n\n    myapp.harp.io/                    <-- root of your application (assets in the root not served)\n      |- harp.json                    <-- configuration, globals goes here.\n      +- public/                      <-- your application assets belong in the public dir\n          |- _layout.jade             <-- optional layout file\n          |- index.jade               <-- must have an index.html or index.jade file\n          |- _shared/                 <-- arbitrary directory for shared partials\n          |   +- nav.jade             <-- a partial for navigation\n          +- articles/                <-- pages in here will have \"/articles/\" in URL (old school style)\n              |- _data.json           <-- articles metadata goes here\n              +- hello-world.jade     <-- must have an index.html or index.jade file\n\n<a name=\"rules-2\"/>\n### 2) Public Directory is public.\n\nYour `public` directory is required to have a functioning harp application. It defines what will be served publicly and what URLs your application exposes. Public assets belong in the `public` directory and assets outside of the `public` directory will not be served.\n\n    myapp.harp.io/\n      |- README.md                    <--- won't be served\n      |- secrets.txt                  <--- won't be served\n      +- public/                      <--- required public directory\n          +- index.html               <--- will be served\n\n<a name=\"rules-3\"/>\n### 3) Ignore those which start with underscore.\n\nAny files or directories that begin with underscore will be ignored by the server. This is the recommended naming convention for `layout` and `partial` files. Harp will honour this rule for both files and directories.\n\n**Design Rationale:** By having a simple convention. It is easy to specify and identify which assets will not be served to the end user.\n\n**Example:**\n\n    myapp.harp.io/\n      +- public/\n          |- index.html               <--- will be served\n          |- _some-partial.jade       <--- won't be served\n          +- _shared-partials/        <--- won't be served\n              +- nav.jade\n\n<a name=\"rules-4\"/>\n### 4) Dead simple asset pipeline.\n\nBoth `jade` and `less` are built into harp. Just add an extension of `.jade` or `.less` to your file and harp's asset pipeline will do the rest.\n\nHarp knows how to handle jade and less files as html and css respectively. Just add the file, and reference its counterpart.\n    \n    myfile.jade             ->        myfile.html\n    myfile.less             ->        myfile.css\n\nIf you like, you may specify which mime type the file will be served with by prefixing the extension with the desired extension.\n\n    myfile.jade             ->        myfile.html\n    myfile.xml.jade         ->        myfile.xml\n\n...but this is optional as every extension has a default output extension. The following is the same as above...\n\n    myfile.less             ->        myfile.css\n    myfile.css.less         ->        myfile.css\n\n<a name=\"rules-5\"/>\n### 5) Flexible metadata\n\nYour files named `_data.json` are special and make data available to templates.\n\n    myapp.harp.io/\n      +- public/\n          |- index.jade\n          +- articles/\n              |- _data.json           <-- articles metadata goes here\n              |- hello-world.jade     <-- hello world article\n              +- hello-brazil.jade    <-- hello brazil article\n              \nYour `_data.json` file may look contain the following...\n\n    {                                                       <-- avaliable to all templates as globals.public.articles.data\n      \"hello-world\": {                                      <-- because this matches the filename, these variables will be\n        \"title\": \"Hello World. My very first Article.\",         made available in the hello-world.jade template when being\n        \"date\": \"Feb 28, 2013\"                                  served. This object is also available in all the templates\n      },                                                        as globals.public.articles.data.hello-world.\n      \"hello-brazil\": {\n        \"title\": \"Hello Brazil. I like Brazil too.\",\n        \"date\": \"March 4, 2013\"\n      }\n    }\n\nIn our templates we may iterate over the articles with the following in your jade file...\n\n    for article, slug in globals.public.articles.data\n      a(href=\"/articles/#{ slug }\")\n        h2= article.title\n\n<a name=\"documentation\"/>\n## Documentation\n\nHarp can be used as a library or as a command line utility.\n\n<a name=\"cli-usage\"/>\n### CLI Usage\n\n    Usage: harp [command] [options]\n\n    Commands:\n\n      init [path]                 initalize new harp application in current directory\n      server [path] [options]     start harp server\n      compile [path] [options]    compile project to static assets\n      multihost [path] [options]  start harp server to host directory of harp apps\n\n    Options:\n\n      -h, --help     output usage information\n      -V, --version  output the version number\n\nStart the server in root of your application by running...\n\n    harp server\n\nYou may optionally supply a port to listen on...\n\n    harp server --port 8002\n\nCompile an application from the root of your application by running...\n\n    harp compile\n\nYou may optionally pass in a path to where you want the compiled assets to go...\n\n    harp compile --output /path/to/phonegap/project/www\n\n<a name=\"lib-usage\"/>\n### Lib Usage\n\nYou may also use harp as a node library for compiling or running as a server.\n\n    var harp = require(\"harp\")\n\nserve up harp application\n\n    harp.server(projectPath [,args] [,callback])\n\ncompile harp application\n\n    harp.compile(projectPath [,outputPath] [, callback])\n    \n<a name=\"contributing\"/>\n## Contributing\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\nIf you find a bug you would like fixed.
